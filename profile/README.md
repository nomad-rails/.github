## What is Nomad?🤔
Nomad is your passport to seamless crypto off-ramping in Africa, built by Africans.
Crypto Off-ramping in Africa usually involves switching between multiple tools and steps to get spendable cash (fiat). Most of these tools are untrustworthy, time-consuming, and inefficient, adding a layer of complexity to interacting with crypto.
### Where does Nomad come in?
Nomad steps in as a solution that seamlessly integrates with existing financial tools such as bank transfers and ATM cards, to offer users access to crypto and off-ramping.  
Where users typically have to move to and fro multiple interfaces to offramp, nomad presents itself as an all-in-one package, embedded with features that streamline off-ramping, making it easy and seamless.  
Nomad is not just another app, wallet, or tool. It's a solution that solely aims to eliminate the need for third-party tools when interacting with crypto. 
### How does Nomad do this?
Nomad achieves this with its innovative USSD feature.    
This USSD feature empowers users to create wallets, conduct crypto transactions, and initiate off-ramping on a USSD interface!  
Nomad aims to make interacting with crypto as easy and comfortable as dialing 911. 
Nomad provides this using account abstraction on Squads Protocol
Cards sevices are built on the fine divide of web2 and web3 services. On the on-chain side we leverage Seabed Labs Pre-Authorized Debit and on the Web2 side we partnered with a card Issuer to allows KYC'd users spend in local currencies straight from their phantom wallet.
