## What is Nomad?
Nomad is your passport to seamless crypto off-ramping in Africa, built by Africans.
Crypto Off-ramping in Africa usually involves switching between multiple tools and steps to get spendable cash (fiat). Most of these tools are untrustworthy, time-consuming, and inefficient, adding a layer of complexity to interacting with crypto.
### Where does Nomad come in?
Nomad is not just another wallet, app, or tool. 
It is a solution that seamlessly integrates with existing financial channels such as; bank transfers and ATM cards, to give access to crypto and off-ramping
### How does Nomad do this?
What sets Nomad apart is its innovative USSD feature.  
Nomads USSD feature empowers users to create wallets, and send and receive crypto directly, all without needing third-party tools.  

Through this USSD functionality, users can easily access crypto and initiate off-ramping via integrated bank transfer channels. Everything happens on the USSD interface!    
Nomad aims to make interacting with crypto as easy and comfortable as dialing 911.
